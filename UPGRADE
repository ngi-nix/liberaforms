Upgrading GNGforms

PLEASE read this before upgrading.

Most upgrades only require you to do this:

cd GNGforms
git pull origin master
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ./requirements.txt
supervisorctl restart GNGforms

but...!! Some upgrades may require special attention.

BEFORE upgrading..
1. Backup your database
2. Check your current "GNGforms version" and "Mongo schema version".

* You can find these version numbers by navigating to the config page

_______________________________________
# Your GNGforms version is less than 32
We integrated mongoengine into GNGforms 32, and a lot of code got changed.

1. If your "Schema version" is less than 13, read below FIRST.
2. Make sure your Schema version is 13.
3. Change one line in config.cfg

#MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/GNGforms"
MONGODB_SETTINGS = {'host': 'mongodb://localhost:27017/GNGforms'}

Now continue with normal upgrade.

_____________________________________
# Your Schema version is less than 13
Update to version 13

1. Pull the code

cd GNGforms
git pull origin pre-mongoengine
supervisorctl restart GNGforms

2. Navigate to the config page and update the database.
Now you will be running GNGforms 31 with Schema version 13
